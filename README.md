# Hidden Gems of Michigan

> Discovering the lesser-known treasures of the Great Lakes State and driving tourism dollars to local communities

## 🌟 About

**Hidden Gems** is an intelligent travel planning platform designed to help travelers discover the authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences that Michigan has to offer. Our mission is to connect visitors with unique local attractions, driving tourism dollars to smaller communities and supporting local economies across the state.

While many travelers know about Michigan's popular destinations like Mackinac Island or Traverse City, countless hidden gems remain undiscovered.

Our platform makes it easy to find and plan trips to these special places.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Michigan's tourism industry is often concentrated in well-known destinations, leaving many smaller communities and unique attractions undiscovered. This concentration means:

- Local businesses in smaller communities miss out on tourism revenue
- Travelers miss authentic, uncrowded experiences

**Hidden Gems** addresses this by making it easy to discover and plan trips to these lesser-known destinations, spreading tourism dollars more equitably across the state.
